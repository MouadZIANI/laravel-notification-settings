### Issues

When creating issues, please provide as much details as possible. A clear explanation on the issue and a reliable production example can help us greatly in improving this project. Your issue may get closed if it cannot be easily reproduced.

If your issue gets closed for not providing enough info or not responding to the maintainers' comments, do not consider it a hostile action. There are probably other issues that the maintainers are working on and must give priority to issues that are well investigated, you can always revisit the issue and address the reasons that it was closed and we will be happy to re-open it and address it properly. Sometimes a commit will close your issue without a response from the maintainers so make sure you read the issue timeline to prevent any misunderstandings.

### Code Style

The code style is enforced with [Laravel Coding Style](https://laravel.com/docs/master/contributions#coding-style). Any violation of the code style may prevent merging your contribution so make sure you follow it. And yes we love the perfection.

### Pull Requests

- PRs should have titles that are clear as possible.
- Make sure that your PR is up to date with the branch you are targeting, use `git rebase` for this.
- Unfinished/In-Progress PRs should have `[WIP]` prefix to them, and preferably a checklist for ongoing todos.
